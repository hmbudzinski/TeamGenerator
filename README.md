# TeamGenerator
## What: 
  The objective of this homework was to create a team generator that allows the user to input the information of the manager of their team and then to add as many engineers and interns as the user wants and then posts them in the html. 

## Why:
    this activity had us utilize node.js, constructiors, prompts, and classes.

## How:
    I started this project by creating my class constructors, i then created my prompts for the manager and then the function to cycle through the other functions i was going to create for creating the intern, engineer, and exit fuctions. 

## Features:
    My page is able to take in the user input and build a dev team in an html.

## Difficulties:
    The hardest part of this assignment was the basic organization and understanding the code that was given to us. Once I was able to undertsand the starter code and the basic path that my code should take, creating the functionality was not as bad as i first thought.
